 PK3ENTRY lump managment
 
 DelphiDoom and RAD are using PK3ENTRY lump to define long filename aliases inside WAD files.

This is a command line tool that:

-Inserts PK3 files inside a WAD file

The output WAD file contains long filename aliases (PK3ENTRY lump)

The PK3ENTRY lump is parsed by DelphiDoom and RAD PK3 loaders and create long filename aliases from WAD lumps.

-Split WAD files that contain PK3ENTRY lump(s) to PK3 and WAD
